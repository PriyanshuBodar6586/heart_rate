             Other common mistakes include:
â€¢ Falling to rest before a measurement. Sitting quietly for about five minutes can help relax the body.

â€¢ Placing a cuff over clothing. Depending on the thickness of the sleeve, clothing can add up to 50 mmHg to a reading. The blood pressure cuff needs to be placed on a bare arm - so roll up your sleeve or come wearing short sleeves

â€¢ Using the wrong sized cuff. Squeezing an arm into a cuff that's too small can add anywhere between 2 mmHg and 10 mmHg to a measurement.

â€¢Engaging in conversation. Avoid the small talk. Even active listening can add 10 mmHg.""",style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white,fontSize: 19.sp),),
