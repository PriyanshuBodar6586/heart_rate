ðŸ‘‰ A fast heart rate isn't always a concern. For instance, the heart rate typically rises during exercise or as a response to stress.

ðŸ‘‰ when the heart beats too fast, it may not pump enough blood to the rest of the body. As a result, the organs and tissues may not get enough oxygen.

ðŸ‘‰ in general, tachycardia may lead to the following signs and symptoms:

ðŸ‘‰ Sensation of a racing, pounding heartbeat or flopping in the chest (palpitations).

ðŸ‘‰ Chest pain

ðŸ‘‰ Fainting (syncope)

ðŸ‘‰ Lightheartedness

ðŸ‘‰ Rapid pulse rate

ðŸ‘‰ Shortness of breath

ðŸ‘‰ Tachycardia may not cause any symptoms or
complications. But if left untreated, some forms of
tachycardia can lead to serious health problems
including:

ðŸ‘‰ Fainting: A person with a rapid heartbeat may lose consciousness, increasing their risk of a fall or other accident.

Sudden death: This usually only occurs with ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation.
ðŸ‘‰ Blood clots: These can significantly increase the risk of heart attack or stroke.

ðŸ‘‰ Heart failure: Without treatment, the heart car become weaker, increasing the risk of heart failure.

ðŸ‘‰ The risk of complications depends on several factors, including:

ðŸ‘‰ The severity and duration of the tachycardia the type

ðŸ‘‰ The overall health of the person

ðŸ‘‰ Any other heart conditions they may have.""",style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white,fontSize: 19.sp),),
